## üèÜ Achievement
**2nd Place Winner** in the [Name of Hackathon] hosted by [Organization Name].

## üìñ Project Overview
This project was a data-driven case study for a leading beverage distributor facing challenges in:
- Understanding regional customer preferences.
- Optimizing inventory to reduce overstocking and stockouts.
- Analyzing pricing strategies to maximize revenue.
- Identifying seasonal sales trends.

The goal was to analyze their sales data and provide actionable, data-backed recommendations to improve operational efficiency and profitability.

## üìä Data Description
The dataset contained over [Number] rows of sales records with the following key attributes:
- **Sales:** `Sale (Dollars)`, `Bottles Sold`, `Volume Sold (Liters)`
- **Product:** `Item Description`, `Category Name`, `Bottle Volume (ml)`
- **Store & Location:** `Store Name`, `City`, `County`, `Store Location`
- **Financials:** `State Bottle Cost`, `State Bottle Retail`

*Note: The original dataset is not included in this repository due to its proprietary nature.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Power BI:** For primary data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data exploration, cleaning, and pivot table analysis.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** To create calculated columns and measures for KPIs.
- **Data Visualization:** Designed intuitive and impactful charts for stakeholder reporting.

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Measures
I developed the following core DAX measures to drive the analysis:

| KPI | DAX Measure Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Sales** | Calculate total revenue. |
| **Total Profit** | `SUMX(Sales, (Retail - Cost) * Quantity)` |
| **Profit Margin** | `(Total Profit / Total Sales)` |
| **Inventory Turnover** | `SUM(Bottles Sold) / AVERAGE(Inventory)` |
| **Stockout Rate** | Percentage of items with zero stock. |
| **MoM Sales Growth** | Month-over-Month sales percentage change. |

## üîç Main Insights & Recommendations
### 1. Sales Performance
- **Insight:** The top 5 products contributed to over 30% of total revenue. Carbonated drinks dominated sales, but health-conscious beverages showed a 15% YoY growth.
- **Recommendation:** Focus marketing budgets on high-growth categories like functional health drinks in urban areas.

### 2. Inventory Management
- **Insight:** 20% of products were consistently overstocked, tying up capital, while 8% faced frequent stockouts during peak summer months.
- **Recommendation:** Implement a dynamic inventory system with reorder points based on historical seasonal demand.

### 3. Pricing Strategy
- **Insight:** Products in the `Craft Soda` category showed low price elasticity, meaning a 5% price increase did not significantly affect demand.
- **Recommendation:** Apply a strategic price increase on low-elasticity items to boost profit margins without losing sales.

### 4. Regional Trends
- **Insight:** Sales of premium beverages were 40% higher in urban store locations compared to rural ones.
- **Recommendation:** Develop region-specific product assortments and promotions.
